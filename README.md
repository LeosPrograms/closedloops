Rust implementations of algorithms and tools for Multilateral Trade Credit Set-off (MTCS).

This repository hosts the `mtcs` rust crate which provides -

* A library containing implementations of algorithms used for MTCS.
* A CLI tool that runs MTCS on a specified input CSV file (containing a list of obligations) and outputs the resulting set-off notices as a CSV file.

## CLI usage

```shell
$ cargo run -- --help
Tool for running Multilateral Trade Credit Set-off (MTCS) on an obligation network

Usage: mtcs-cli [OPTIONS] --input-file <INPUT_FILE> --output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>

Options:
  -i, --input-file <INPUT_FILE>    Path to input CSV file with obligations (fields - `id` (optional), `debtor`, `creditor`, `amount`)
  -o, --output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>  Path to output CSV file
  -v, --verbose...                 Log level
  -h, --help                       Print help information
  -V, --version                    Print version information
```

The input is expected to be a CSV file containing a list of obligations with the following header fields - `id` (optional), `debtor`, `creditor` & `amount`. For example -

```shell
$ cat data/micro.csv
id,debtor,creditor,amount
1,10,20,100
2,20,30,100
3,30,10,200
4,40,30,100
```

The output is a CSV file containing a list of set-offs with the following header fields - `id` & `amount`. For every obligation we state the setoff amount. For
example -

```shell
$ cargo run -- --input-file data/micro.csv --output-file micro-set-offs.csv
$ cat micro-set-offs.csv
debtor,creditor,amount,setoff,remainder
10,20,0,100,0
20,30,0,100,0
30,10,200,100,100
```
